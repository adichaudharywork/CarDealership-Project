# CarDealership-Project
Simulated a car dealership using object oriented programming(OOP).
OOPS Concepts used:
1) Classes and Objects: the projects uses classes like Dealership, Vehicle, Employee and Customers to model real world entities.
2)Encapsulation: Data related to Customers and Vehicles is kept private within the classes. Getters and Setters functions are provided to access this data.
3)Polymorphism: Overrided toString Method so the application can print proper output.
